### Analytical Approach

#### *Data Collection*
The dataset for the analysis was provided by the incubator Hub,an orgainization built to train and support women in technology.The data was provided in excel workbook format for easy accessibility.

#### *Data manipulation*
- *Data Cleaning*:
   .Removed duplicates entry in excel and checkedfor speling errors and blank cells to ensure data quality.
- *Data Transformation*
   .Ensured all data fields were assigned correctly with the date field formatted to date formats.
   . Created new columns:
     - Cancelation Rate: Using conditional Formation in Power Bi a column cancelation rate was created to enable manipulation of the data contained in the canceled column.
     - Subscription Duration: Extracted the duration between subscription start date and subscription end data by using the add column button and finding the difference between the two 
       dates.
### *Tools Used*
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis using pivot table.[Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
- SQL For querying of data.
- POWERBI for data visualization.
